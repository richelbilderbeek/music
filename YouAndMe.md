# You And Me

'You And Me' is a song written by me on the 4th of June 2005 to and
including 1st July 2005 for the boyband 'The Loveboys'. Too bad the band
seperated before its first performance.

## Lyrics

```
You And Me
By Richel Bilderbeek

My life 
changed tremendously 
when you came to see 
the Loveboys and (especially) me 

You threw 
your knickers to me 
so that I would see 
you want to be with me 

Due to that gift 
I've fallen in love 
just wanting to see 
you lying next to me 

And that night 
this dream became true 
made love all night 
then breakfast for you 

When I said 
your breasts are to small 
you started to cry 
I didn't knew why 

So I said 
I'll pay the operation 
so I can see 
your breasts more easily 

So we
talked near-infinitely
until you and me
could the solution see

You agreed 
to get bigger breasts
so that I could see
your breasts more easily

And also I
had to get an eye-operation
so that I could see
more easily

And that week
we both had surgery
and I couldn't wait
your bigger breasts to see

But when my eyes
we fixed finally
your breasts weren't just big
but gigantically enormously

This
then caused for me
that I couldn't be
with you foreverly

For you
this was painfully
you got depressed
because you missed me

Then you
committed suicide
because you couldn't be
without me

And now
I see very clearly
that I should have
behaved differently

Since then
I changed heavily
it's the inside that counts
you made me this see very clearly

So I hope
you and your big breasts live happily
because in heaven
there is no gravity
```

## Background

This song started during my time in Bristol.
As with most non-parody songs, I already composed
and rehearsed the lyrics.

One day, I met two guys and we wanted to form a
commercial boy-band, named 'The Loveboys'. Instead
of traditional boy-band songs, I wanted a song
in which much happens, a 'rollercoaster of emotions'.
Yet, to be a commercial success, the future fans 
should be able to memorize the lyrics easily.
Like traditional boy-bands, I decided to keep the
lyrics simple to remember.

Upon sharing the song with the other Loveboys, we
started making plans and rules for our performances.

We disagreed on how to distribute the female fans.
I suggested that the other two Loveboys would get
at most two female fans each (if any would be 
interested in them), and I would take care of the rest.
This suggestion came from the fact that I was already
an experienced performer and know how to handle masses
of women, unlike them. I wanted to protect them from
themselves, as it is the strongest shoulders that
can carry the heaviest loads. 

One of the other Loveboys disagreed. He wanted to
share the female fans equally. My trueisms did
not reach him. The third Loveboy had no stance in
this. Thus we broke up, before our first performance.
I did keep in the reference to the Loveboys. 

I think the story is a bad joke in itself,
helped by the ridiculous rhyming scheme.
And the song even has a traditional bad joke in the end!
