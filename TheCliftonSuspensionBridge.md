The Clifton Suspension Bridge
By Richel Bilderbeek
 
Should I stay 
should I go 
what I want 
I do not know 
 
Take the 
shortest way home 
or try to get there 
not alone 
 
Then I take 
a single step 
there is no way 
getting back 
 
I see a cave 
in the ridge 
then the bottom 
of the bridge 
 
I don't stay 
I just go 
what's left to do 
I know 
 
Then I write 
the one song 
I try to write 
my whole life long 
 
For my girl 
for my friends 
with a bad joke 
in the end 
 
And then I'm 
feeling sad 
because 
I miss her 
 
And then I 
say out loud 
how much 
I love her 
 
And then I 
tell a bird 
how much 
I loved her 
 
Then Superman 
breaks my fall 
I give my girl 
a call 
 
Then we go 
to a pub 
Superman gets 
really drunk 

And that night 
I show my girl 
I can all he can 
except fly
```

## Background

I composed this song at a conservatory's practice piano in Bristol.
The initial two notes impressed me in being both simple, repetitive,
beautiful and depressing. The simplicity of those two notes resulted in
a text that is just as simple. I enjoy the build-up of the song,
from sad to dark to the bad joke in the end.
