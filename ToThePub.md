To The Pub

To the pub
to the pub
to the pub 
pubbidubbidubub

From early in the morning
until the day is dawning
and we know that we are happy men

Everybody knows 
his favorite brand
We all start to smile
when we fine'ly have one
maybe
you can never be sure
there'll be one two twentythousand more

To the pub
to the pub
to the pub 
pubbidubbidubub

The barladies are singing
while we are just beginning
and again we know that we are happy men
```
