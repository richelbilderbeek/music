# "Friday"

'"Friday"' (note the quotation marks) is an
improvement of Rebecca Black's 'Friday' (note no quotation marks).
Although I do like the original, I have read all critiques on it and
implemented those.

[VERSE1]
.7 zip, extract in the morning 
source's gotta be fresh, gotta new download
gotta have my tools, gotta have mercurial
Checkin' everything, the std::time is goin'
Tickin' on and on, internal std::clock is rushin'
Data going down through the bus wire
Overclocked my card, my fan is my friend (my fan) 

[PUSHPOP]
Pushing in the front side 
Popping in the back side
Gotta make my mind up 
Which container can I take? 

[FRIDAY]
It's "Friday", "Friday" 
My computer std::clock states it's "Friday"
Definition lookin' up for the term "weekend", "weekend" 
"Friday", "Friday"
Loadin' down on "Friday" 
Definition must be looked up for "weekend", "weekend" 

[POWER4]
Programming, programming (Yeah) 
Programming, programming (Yeah) 
std::mem_fun, std::mem_fun_ref
Definition must be looked up for "weekend", "weekend"

[VERSE2]
7:45, we're going' to Assembler
Profilin' so fast, I want std::time to fly
MOV, MOV, think about MOV
You know EAX 
I got this, you got this 
It's friend has private (access) rights, ay 
I got this, you got this 
Now you trace it

[PUSHPOP]

[FRIDAY]

[POWER4]

[PAST]
"Yesterday" == "Thursday", "Thursday"
"Today" == "Friday", "Friday" (Partyin')
We-we are asserting 
static_asserting
We gonna have no bugs "Today"

[FUTURE]
"Today" + 1 == "Saturday"
And "Sunday" comes after (prefix) ++
I don't want a Week to have Week::end()

[VERSE3]
R-B, Richel Bilderbeek
So pushing' in the front side (In the front side) 
In the back side (In the back side) 
I'm debuggin', tracin' (Yeah, yeah) 
Fast lookup, switchin' terms 
Wit' a profiler on my side (Woo!) 
(C'mon) Passin' by is a stack trace in front of me 
Make bits switch, bits shift, wanna see
Check my std::time, it's "Friday", it's a "weekend"
We press F5 to run, c'mon, c'mon, y'all 

[FRIDAY]
