[VERSE1]
.7 zip, extract in the morning 
source's gotta be fresh, gotta new download
gotta have my tools, gotta have mercurial
'Checkin' everything, the time is goin'
Tickin' on and on, internal clock is rushin'
Data going down through the bus wire
Overclocked my card, my fan is my friend (my fan) 

[PUSHPOP]
Pushing in the front side 
Popping in the back side
Gotta make my mind up 
Which container can I take? 

[FRIDAY]
It's "Friday", "Friday" 
My computer std::clock states it's "Friday"
Definition lookin' up for the term "weekend", "weekend" 
"Friday", "Friday"
Loadin' down on "Friday" 
Definition must be looked up for "weekend", "weekend" 

[POWER4]
Programming, programming (Yeah) 
Programming, programming (Yeah) 
Fun to the power four
Definition must be looked up for "weekend", "weekend"

[VERSE2]
7:45, we're going' to Assembler
Profilin' so fast, I want time to fly
MOV, MOV, think about MOV
You know EAX 
I got this, you got this 
It's friend has private (access) rights, ay 
I got this, you got this 
Now you trace it

[PUSHPOP]

[FRIDAY]

[POWER4]

[PAST]
"Yesterday" equals "Thursday", "Thursday"
"Today" equals "Friday", "Friday" (Partyin')
We-we are asserting 
We so asserting
We gonna have no bugs 'Today'

[FUTURE]
"Today" plus one equals "Saturday"
And "Sunday" comes after (prefix) increment
I don't want a Week to have 'end'

[VERSE3]
R-B, Richel Bilderbeek
So pushing' in the front side (In the front side) 
In the back side (In the back side) 
I'm debuggin', tracin' (Yeah, yeah) 
Fast lookup, switchin' terms 
Wit' a profiler on my side (Woo!) 
(C'mon) Passin' by is a call trace in front of me 
Makes tick tock, tick tock, wanna see
Check my time, it's "Friday", it's a "weekend"
We are having fun, c'mon, c'mon, y'all
