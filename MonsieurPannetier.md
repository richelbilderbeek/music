En le voyer de son menton elles sensent papillons d'Afrique | When seeing his troat, they felt butterflies from Africa
Le Pannetier est trainer de ne arrêtèr pas prendre leurs coeurs toute de suite | The Pannetier is trained to not stop taking their hearts immediatly 
Il a deja charmer de femmes Anglais Espagnol Portugais Chinois | He has already charmed English, Spanisch, Portugese and Chinese women 
Mais quand il parle mathematique elles se mit à hurler d'effroi | But when he starts talking about mathematics, they all start screaming in terror
---|---
Oh Monsieur Pannetier j'n'veux pas mourir | O, mister Pannetier, I do not want to die
Monsieur Pannetier laissez moi partir | Mister Pannetier, please let me go
---|---
Il leur montra son crayon son stylo sa passeur et les photos d'sa diagramme | He shows them his pencil, pen, compass and his graphs 
Il leur monter avec un grande fiere des theoremes d'Euler de integrale | He shows them with big pride the theories of Euler about integration
Il leur fit voir des journaux academic personne ne réagit non plus | He show then them academic journals, nobody reacts either  
Désespéré elles prennent des avenues pour direr de verite toutes nues elles dit | Desperate, they take the ways to tell the naked truth and they say
---|---
Oh Monsieur Pannetier j'n'veux pas mourir | O, mister Pannetier, I do not want to die
Monsieur Pannetier laissez moi partir | Mister Pannetier, please let me go

Quand le Theo vu sa monologue eclatant est pas du comprehends il rit | When Theo saw that his radiant monologues were not understood, he smiled
Mais dans sa tête une idée saugrenue une idée farfelue surgi | But in his head a crazy farfetched idea arose
Dans un bureau où était ses formels il entraîna leurs même les femmes | In his office where his equations were, he trained the girls themselves
Qui en voyant les femmes se ruer sur lui avec tant d'appétit hurla | He saw the women rush on him with so much appetite and screams
---|---
Oh Monsieur Pannetier j'n'veux pas mourir | O, mister Pannetier, I do not want to die
Monsieur Pannetier laissez moi partir | Mister Pannetier, please let me go

Pendant 8 jours elles resta enfermé et il se enseigner en vain | For 8 days, they were locked in his office and he educated them in vain 
Et comme déjà il n'etait pas bien gros il perdit 20 kilos au moins | And as already he was not very fat he lost 20 kilos at least
Quand arriva l'instant ou le perspicacité il fais comprendre sa temps est passé | When the moment of the great idea came, it made him understand he lost his time 
Prends ton tronçonneusion et retourne chez elles le pauvre femmes s'écria jamais | He took his chainsawion, returned to them, the poor women never cried again 

## Background

On one day, when I saw when of my colleagues, instantly, the chorus was born.
As with other songs (e.g. 'Het Leven Is Een Vuile Kolerelijer'), I knew the to-be-born
song would distract me, until I would give birth to it.

I knew my French is good enough to manage, but I asked some people to help
me correct my mistakes and/or sing the lyrics. Instead of 'no', I got 
'maybe(-that-in-practice-is-a-no)'. The urge to write proper French left me, 
and I changed the style to be badly written French on purpose. It also helped
me having more similar syllables between original and parody lyrics.

While writing the song, I did not know how it would end. Would mister
Pannetier get the girls or not? Traditionally, the song ended in a bad joke.
A very cliche even-worse-than-bad-French bad joke.

Perhaps one day, I will sing the song, and perhaps I will do so while
playing the piano as well. But I do already enjoy the lyrics and that
the chorus is out of my head.
