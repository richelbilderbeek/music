## Removed verses

```
A very long time ago
I was in Bristol
and I wanted to go clubbing

But at first
I only found clubs
that were shitty 
and had many windows

Then after a while
I found a club
without windows and a short queue

But when
I was to go in
into the Halifax
I found out it was a money machine
```

## Background

This was an on-the-fly translation of [Het Leven Is Naar](HetLevenIsNaar.md), as I feel
like making a high-quality translation.
