# Voor De Klas

'Voor De Klas' was written by me on the 10th
November 2010. Tabs were used from the song 'Ik Wou Dat Ik Jou Was' from
Veldhuis & Kemper.

## Background

I find the original song, 'Ik wou dat ik jou was' fascinating:
the melody is pretty, but I think the lyrics are completely
irrational. Sure, the lyrics sound good when listening 
superficially, but when listening more careful, it does
not make sense: one *can* change his/her behavior.

While I was practicing the melody of the song, 
I was really wishing I would be my old self again.
I noticed that teaching secondary school kids had
changed me, as it made me change how I see the world:
I *see* people since being a teacher. With that new
information, I behave differently. And I longed for
my simpler behavior while I was more ignorant of people.

The story was easy to write, by just dramatizing and
ridiculizing some event that did happen in my 
classroom (all names are fictional).
I was happy to see how in the end I dared ridiculizing 
myself as well. In the final sentence, I wished 
being with a girl I lost contact with, due to teaching
and its effects. No bad joke in the end, but I think 
the main storyline is a bad enough joke already.
