## Background

I wanted to write the sort of tear-jerker (NL: 'smartlap') in which
a lot of things happen. This song was written at the same time as
[Kinderliefde](07_kinderliefde.md), in which even more happens.

The name 'Peter' was initially picked just for the rhyme. 
When in later versions it would not contribute to
rhyming anymore, the name was simply left it.
