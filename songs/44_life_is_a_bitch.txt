Life Is A Bitch

These are the removed verses:

A very long time ago
I was in Bristol
and I wanted to go clubbing

But at first
I only found clubs
that were shitty 
and had many windows

Then after a while
I found a club
without windows and a short queue

But when
I was to go in
into the Halifax
I found out it was a money machine
