[Verse]

C                G                      Am

  Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while

           F                            G

Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies

               Dm                      F

Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst

                       G6   Fmaj7   G6   C

Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

 

C           G                      Am

Let us die young or let us live forever

           F                            G

We don't have the power, but we never say never

               Dm                      F

Sitting in the sandpit, life is a short trip

                        G6   Fmaj7   G6   C

The music's for the sad man

 

C                G                    Am

Can you imagine when this race is won

           F                       G

Turn our golden faces into the sun

               Dm                      F

Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune

                       G6   Fmaj7   G6   C

The music's played by the mad man

 

[Chorus]

C         G

  Forever Young

          Am         F

I want to be Forever Young

G                      Am

 Do you really want to live forever?

F       G

 Forever, and ever

C         G

  Forever Young,

          Am         F

I want to be Forever Young

G                     Am

Do you really want to live forever?

F  G         C

     Forever Young.

 

[Verse]

C                G                      Am

Some are like water, some are like the heat

           F                         G

Some are the melody and some are the beat

               Dm                     F

Sooner or later they all will be gone

                       G6   Fmaj7   G6   C

Why don't they stay young?

 

C                G                      Am

It's so hard to get old without a cause

           F                            G

I don't want to perish like a fading horse

                 Dm              F

Youth's like diamonds in the sun

                       G6   Fmaj7   G6   C

And diamonds are forever

 

C                G                Am

So many adventures given up today

           F                    G

So many songs we forgot to play

               Dm                      F

So many dreams swinging out of the blue

                       G6   Fmaj7   G6   C

Oh let it come true

 

[Chorus]

C         G

  Forever Young

          Am         F

I want to be Forever Young

G                      Am

 Do you really want to live forever?

F       G

 Forever, and ever

C         G

  Forever Young,

          Am         F

I want to be Forever Young

G                     Am

Do you really want to live forever?

F  G         C

     Forever Young.

 

[Solo]

 

[Chorus]

C         G

  Forever Young

          Am         F

I want to be Forever Young

G                      Am

 Do you really want to live forever?

F       G

 Forever, and ever

C         G

  Forever Young,

          Am         F

I want to be Forever Young

G                     Am

Do you really want to live forever?

F  G         C

     Forever Young.
