# You And Me

'You And Me' is a song written by me on the 4th of June 2005 to and
including 1st July 2005 for the boyband 'The Loveboys'. Too bad the band
seperated before its first performance.

## Background

This song started during my time in Bristol.
As with most non-parody songs, I already composed
and rehearsed the lyrics.

One day, I met two guys and we wanted to form a
commercial boy-band, named 'The Loveboys'. Instead
of traditional boy-band songs, I wanted a song
in which much happens, a 'rollercoaster of emotions'.
Yet, to be a commercial success, the future fans 
should be able to memorize the lyrics easily.
Like traditional boy-bands, I decided to keep the
lyrics simple to remember.

Upon sharing the song with the other Loveboys, we
started making plans and rules for our performances.

We disagreed on how to distribute the female fans.
I suggested that the other two Loveboys would get
at most two female fans each (if any would be 
interested in them), and I would take care of the rest.
This suggestion came from the fact that I was already
an experienced performer and know how to handle masses
of women, unlike them. I wanted to protect them from
themselves, as it is the strongest shoulders that
can carry the heaviest loads. 

One of the other Loveboys disagreed. He wanted to
share the female fans equally. My trueisms did
not reach him. The third Loveboy had no stance in
this. Thus we broke up, before our first performance.
I did keep in the reference to the Loveboys. 

I think the story is a bad joke in itself,
helped by the ridiculous rhyming scheme.
And the song even has a traditional bad joke in the end!
