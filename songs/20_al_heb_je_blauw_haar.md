## Background

This song originated from a misunderstanding. There was a girl with
blue hair that I had fallen in love with, without knowing her well.
I wanted to meet, so I could learn to know her. When we met, however,
I felt that she thought it was about something else. Disappointed in her, I
left early, came home, started playing the piano, and the first verse
was born.

Because a typical Richel Bilderbeek song has a bad joke in the end,
I added some verses.
