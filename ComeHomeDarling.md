Come Home Darling

Come home darling
I will hold you
Come home darling
I will kiss you

You're the one
I've always searched for
I will love you
night and day

I don't believe in God
but I'm in love with you
so if he exists
I hope he's watching you.
'cause you are far away
far over the sea
but in all my dreams
you are still
with me

Come home darling
I will hold you
Come home darling
I will kiss you

Everyday,
I long for you
and everyday,
I'm loving you
and everyday
I'm missing you
and every day,
I get more close to you
```

## Background

I was missing a girlfriend of mine, while sitting behind a piano.
I wanted to write a cheesy love song, as she loves cheesy love
songs (for example, 'My Heart Will Go On'). I think I did 
a good job in writing such a cheesy love song :-)
