Richel Bilderbeek enjoys making music with fun lyrics
and a bad joke in the end. That he considers himself
a bad singer and mediocre piano player does not hold him back
in giving [performances](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/performances)
regularily.

## Formations

### The Bilderbeek Bilderbeek & Bogaart Bogaart Quartet

'The Bilderbeek Bilderbeek & Bogaart Bogaart Quartet' was the band
that consisted out of me and Geert van den Bogaart. I played
two flutes (at the same time) and played the piano
in [Ode Aan Masculiniteit](songs/03_ode_aan_masculiniteit.md), where
Geert did the piano in the other songs and did the vocals.

### The Fanstars

'The Fanstars' was the band I was pianist of.
