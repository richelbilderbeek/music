## Background

A friend of mine was a presenter of a radio program. She hinted
that she'd like to once play a song of mine. I thought most of
the songs until then were to rough for radio, so I wanted to
write a sweet and cute and friendly song. I felt, as a biologist,
it should have an organism, and I had the idea she would like that
as well. When I heared the original song, the chorus of this song was
born. When Richelifying the verses, I was happy that the song ended
elagantly as well.
