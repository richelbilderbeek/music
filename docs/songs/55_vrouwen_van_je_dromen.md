## Background

I noticed from personal experience the cycle in this
song: a man meets a new girl, he thinks she is the girl of
his dreams, they get any form of relationship, and then they break up,
after which this repeats. I wondered how to explain this.

So I made up a potential ridiculous (but still possibly true!)
story to facilitate this cycle to happen.
The story ends with one of the potential causes of the
cycle in reality. No bad joke in the end, as the story arc
is already bad joke enough.
