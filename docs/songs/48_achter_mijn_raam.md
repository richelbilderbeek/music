## Background

I was looking through my window, and thinking about how
people with a personality disorder may experience the world.
This song is not necessarily about a person with a personality
disorder, but it is how the world could be experienced from
a different point-of-view than (I assume) most people. I added
some empathy to the mix, to have a more loving end.
