## Background

On one day, when I saw when of my colleagues, instantly, the chorus was born.
As with other songs (e.g. 'Het Leven Is Een Vuile Kolerelijer'), I knew the to-be-born
song would distract me, until I would give birth to it.

I knew my French is good enough to manage, but I asked some people to help
me correct my mistakes and/or sing the lyrics. Instead of 'no', I got
'maybe(-that-in-practice-is-a-no)'. The urge to write proper French left me,
and I changed the style to be badly written French on purpose. It also helped
me having more similar syllables between original and parody lyrics.

While writing the song, I did not know how it would end. Would mister
Pannetier get the girls or not? Traditionally, the song ended in a bad joke.
A very cliche even-worse-than-bad-French bad joke.

Perhaps one day, I will sing the song, and perhaps I will do so while
playing the piano as well. But I do already enjoy the lyrics and that
the chorus is out of my head.
