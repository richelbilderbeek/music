## Background

Hoggamus Higgamus is simply an existing text put on music.
The text is written by William James that had this insight when
he used nitrous oxide (aka 'laughing gas') (it is a common
phenomenon that one feels to have deep insights under the
seconds-long influence of nitrous oxide).
The melody, I already had and the two fit together well.
