## Backstory

When trying to improve my Swedish, I listen to the Swedish radio
station SVT P3. The song 'Dum' by Ant Wan, at that moment,
was played often. Too often to my taste. I -a novice in Swedish!- felt
the rhyme was noticably simple. Together with the clear use of an autotune
and a -in my opinion- stock-standard beat and piano music,
made me develop annoyance for the song.
I phrased it as 'an obvious lack of talent',
although I could also phrase it as 'raw' or 'pure' or 'urban'.
Only later I realized: this song probably is already parody!
It is a song in which Ant Wan criticizes this musical genre,
with a purposefully amplified autotune, a childishly simple melody
and materialistic (for example, the protagonist does not understand why a girl
that gets love and flowers, prefers that over getting expensive watches)
and 'dumb' lyrics (for example, the protagonist insinuates it is higher status
to visit people at their place, over having them as guests at one's own home):
Ant Wan is a genius!

In both The Netherlands and in Sweden it is a tradition
to write poems for Christmas that rhyme clumsily. Just in the way 'Dum'
does, with 'mig'/'dig', 'mad'/'bad','här'/'skäl'. From that, the idea
to use Christmas as a context originated, with the same clumsy rhyme.
As I am only mediocre in Swedish, this means the lyrics will be
good enough for the low standard chosen. From the original lyrics,
the Swedish Santa Clause ('tomtenfar' or just 'tomten') arose.
