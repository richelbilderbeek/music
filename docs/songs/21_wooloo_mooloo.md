## Background

As with most non-parody songs, I already composed and
rehearsed the melody.

Then one day, I went as a student to the student disco called
[Wooloomooloo](http://woolloomooloo.nl) in Utrecht. It
was a disenchanting event: I overheard women being harassed
by a guy one the dance floor that was said to have used cocaine
and was dancing 'als een lachende god' (EN: 'like a laughing god').
When I ordered a drink at the bar, I overheard two student girls
talk about how life works and I completely disagreed. They were
talking about 'een leven dat ik toch niet zal snappen' (EN: 'a
life that I would never understand'). I listened in silence,
'om niet de sfeer te verpested' (EN: 'to not ruin the atmosphere').
As I walked to the loo, there was a couple kissing and so drunk that
they nearly collided with the wall. At the men's, there were
some men talking about who would get which girl.

Those events inspired to write this song. It is the
first sentimental song I wrote. Ironically, some
people thought that I finally showed my true emotions.
I do try to fake so during a performance, but -as a bad actor-,
I assume to fail.

'Wooloo Mooloo' it is one of the fans' favorite songs.
Some of my students even made [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/CDcEgycIWNg)
from a recording.

Note that I misspell the name of the disco. I guess
I misremembered the name, then kept it as such for
historical reasons.
