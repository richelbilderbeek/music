## Background

I composed this song at a conservatory's practice piano in Bristol.
The initial two notes impressed me in being both simple, repetitive,
beautiful and depressing. The simplicity of those two notes resulted in
a text that is just as simple. I enjoy the build-up of the song,
from sad to dark to the bad joke in the end.
