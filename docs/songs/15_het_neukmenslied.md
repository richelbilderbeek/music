## Background

This song is inspired on a friend of mine. One day,
he had a girlfriend. When they spoke, you noticed he
did not like her that much. Every time she asked him
a favor, or to spend time together during the
day, he said no. They argued a lot during the day.

But when it was getting later, he always made up
with her, before going to bed together.

I found this behavior fun. That rascal friend of mine!
The immorality of him, to only get what he wanted!

In the song, I've changed the story a bit, to have a
stronger parody. I assume my friend did not argue with
his girl for a better night, but I will probably never be
sure.
