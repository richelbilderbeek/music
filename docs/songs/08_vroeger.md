## Background

As with most songs, the melody was already composed and rehearsed.
I did write the first two lines already. With the Bogaarts around,
the lyrics escalated.

An important point is the choice of the group of people to blame.
We could have used any group. Due to the the (anti-)metrum,
'asielzoekers' (asylum seekers) was chosen, but we could have
picked any minority group, like for example 'Windows gebruikers' (Windows
users), 'Hipster kleding dragers' (people that wear hipster clothing),
'Neo-Marxistische feministen' (Neo-Marxistic feminists), etcetera.
Sure, the place to visit to ruin the atmosphere back should then be
changed to Redmond, Staphorst or Moskow respectively.

I enjoy that the song offers a nonsensical solution, but a solution
nevertheless, which serves as the bad joke in the end.
