# My bands

## The Bilderbeek Bilderbeek & Bogaart Bogaart Quartet

'The Bilderbeek Bilderbeek & Bogaart Bogaart Quartet' was the band
that consisted out of me and Geert van den Bogaart. I played
two flutes (at the same time) and played the piano
in [Ode Aan Masculiniteit](songs/03_ode_aan_masculiniteit.md), where
Geert did the piano in the other songs and did the vocals.

## The Fanstars

'The Fanstars' was the band I was pianist of.

I rehearsed 1 time with the Groningen (the Netherlands)
band called 'Dubai Coke', before I moved to Sweden.
