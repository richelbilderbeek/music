# The Bilderbeek Bilderbeek & Bogaart Bogaart Quartet

'The Bilderbeek Bilderbeek & Bogaart Bogaart Quartet' was the band 
that consisted out of me and Geert van den Bogaart. I played 
two flutes (at the same time) and played the piano 
in [Ode Aan Masculiniteit](OdeAanMasculiniteit.md), where
Geert did the piano in the other songs and did the vocals.
